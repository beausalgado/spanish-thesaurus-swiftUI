\
how to save the data. because I have to alter it at some point. I could just search for it by name and not save to device. I could save to device but then I have to modify the object somehow. How can I modify the word struct. Maybe it already has a Bool and timestamp, but they are by default null. Can I edit those from the view? I could try both methods and see which one works best for my purposes. Ask ChatGPT too. I need to get to a MVP and then touch up the other project to MVPs and then start looking for work and doing technical tests. Try to see if the cascading approach works too. See if you can get that one running. \
